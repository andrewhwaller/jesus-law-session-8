# Jesus's problem is not with tradition *per se* but leniency.

<!--
* Jesus isn't objecting to the mere existence of extra-biblical traditions.
    * Indeed, the Pharisees are consciously categorizing these traditions as "the tradition of the elders" and *not* Torah.
    * These are applications of Torah that are not being presented as Torah itself.
        * If we're not careful, we will misunderstand the core dispute here, which is not about *adding to Torah*, but about distinctly extra-biblical traditions that permit violations of Torah.
* Jesus uses the binding oath (korban) that the Pharisees permit as an example of lenient tradition missing the mark of biblical law.
    * The Pharisees apparently permit their followers to make a permanently binding oath that devotes property to God, thus preventing it from being used to care for parents.
        * This would be like using your child's college fund as a donation to the church; you can do it, but you're probably sinning against your child by breaking a promise to them.

# The handwashing dispute is not about *kashrut*.

### 1. The Pharisees are concerned about impurity entering the body via ingestion.
### 2. Forbidden animals defile because they are *forbidden*, not because they *transmit* impurity.
### 3. Biblical law *nowhere* rules that one can become ritually impure through ingestion.

# Mark 7:14--20 (NRSV)

“Then he called the crowd again and said to them, ‘Listen to me, all of you, and understand: <span v-mark="{color: '#59b58a', type: 'highlight', click: 1}">there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile</span>, but the things that come out are what defile.’
When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.
<span v-mark="{ color: '#b5595f', type: 'highlight', click: 3 }">He</span> said to them, ‘Then do you also fail to understand?
Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?’
<span v-mark="{ color: '#b5595f', type: 'highlight', click: 3 }">(Thus he declared all foods clean.)</span>
And he said, ‘It is what comes out of a person that defiles.’”

<!--
* Jesus's initial statement is a straightforward agreement with biblical law, i.e., ritual defilement cannot take place via ingestion.
* But then Jesus... throws out biblical law by "declaring all foods clean"?
    * This is typically treated as a narrative aside, i.e., Mark is explaining what Jesus is up to.
        * This reading sees this phrase explaining that Jesus intended to do away with kashrut in some way.
* The problem is that this translation choice makes poor sense of some admittedly awkward syntax.
    * Without going into the grammatical details (see Logan Williams, “The Stomach Purifies All Foods: Jesus’ Anatomical Argument in Mark 7.18–19,” NTS 70.1 (2024): 371–91 for a full treatment of the difficulties), it's highly unusual for a participle to be separated from the word it modifies in this way.
        * For this to be a narrative aside describing Jesus's explanation, καθαρίζων must be modifying the unstated 3MS subject of λέγει in v. 18.
        * This seems unlikely.
            * A more likely explanation is that it modifies ἄνθρωπος in v. 18.

# Mark 7:14--20

“Then he called the crowd again and said to them, ‘Listen to me, all of you, and understand: <span v-mark="{color: '#59b58a', type: 'highlight', click: 1}">there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile</span>, but the things that come out are what defile.’
When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.
He said to them, ‘Then do you also fail to understand?
Do you not see that whatever goes into a <span v-mark="{ color: '#597fb5', type: 'highlight', click: 3 }">person</span> from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer, <span v-mark="{ color: '#597fb5', type: 'highlight', click: 3 }">thus purifying all foods?</span>’
And he said, ‘It is what comes out of a person that defiles.’”

1. According to biblical law, ritual impurity is not caused by ingestion, whether the food is permitted or not.
2. So, whatever enters from outside *by definition cannot ritually defile*!
3. Further, even food that is ritually impure is transformed by the human body via digestion.
4. This is demonstrated by the fact that when food exits the body, it does so as *pure excrement*.
5. But you know what *else* comes ***out*** of a person? Not food, but evil.
6. Evil causes *moral impurity*.
