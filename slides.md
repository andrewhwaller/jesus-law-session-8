# According to Jesus, the problem with the Pharisees is not that they are “strict”!

<!--
* According to the Pharisees' critics, they are too lenient!
* According to Qumran, the Pharisees are "seekers after smooth things/easy interprerations."
* Jesus's problem with the Pharisees is that they adopt lenient policies for the sake of observing purity, but then also neglect "weightier matters."

# How does Jesus engage in early Jewish debates around Torah observance?

<!--
* To state the obvious, Jesus is not the first person to interpret biblical law.
    * As we saw last week, the question "how shall we return?" is very much live in early Judaism. 
    * There are multiple competing conceptions of what Torah observance looks like and what it means to be faithful to the covenant.
* Jesus enters into these ongoing conversations about Torah observance.
    * Jesus isn't the only person stressing Israel's need to remain faithful to God's law.
    * On the other hand, neither is Jesus suggesting a radical break with the Torah.
* Jesus has a particular perspective to contribute to this conversation as a partcicipant alongside his contemporaries.
    * This doesn't lessen the importance and centrality of Jesus's perspective for Christian understandings of the law.
    * Rather, it helps us understand how Jesus, even as the divine author of the Law, also approaches the Law and conversations about the Law as a faithful Israelite.

# Matthew 12:1-8
“At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, ‘Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.’
He said to them, ‘Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple \[profane\] the Sabbath and yet are guiltless?
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.’”

<!--
* Stating this up front: My understanding of this passage has been greatly helped by Paul T. Sloan's SBL 2023 paper on Jesus's halaka in Matt 12. Shout out PTS.

# CD 10:22--23
“No-one is to eat on the Sabbath day except what has been prepared; and from what is lost in the field he should not eat\.\.\.\.”

# Philo, *Life of Moses* 2.22
“For there is no shoot, and no branch, and no leaf even which it is allowed to cut or to pluck on \[the Sabbath\], nor any fruit which it is lawful to gather.”

# *m. Shabbat* 7:2
“The primary prohibited labors are forty minus one: sowing, plowing, harvesting, binding sheaves, threshing, winnowing, selecting, grinding, sifting, kneading, baking\.\.\.\.”

<!--
* The Pharisees' complaint is that Jesus's disciples are harvesting on the Sabbath.
    * Notably, Jesus himself isn't plucking the grain, so regardless of whether or not his disciples are understood to be violating the Sabbath, Jesus himself is not.
* It's common to hear that the Pharisees are concerned about traveling on the Sabbath or some other violation.
    * This doesn't seem to be the case; plucking grain is the issue.
    * CD, Philo, and the Mishnah all contain some prohibition against harvesting (or similar activities) on the Sabbath.
* From the evidence we have, it's not clear that this view would have been universal among first century Jews, but the Pharisees objection to plucking grain is at least plausible.
* Also, the Pharisees don't seem to be presenting an overly strict or exacting view.
    * Even if other groups may have disagreed or held a different opinion about the halakic status of plucking, their objection isn't unreasonable or unheard of.

# Matthew 12:1-8
“At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, ‘Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.’
He said to them, ‘Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple \[profane\] the Sabbath and yet are guiltless?

# 1 Samuel 21:1--6
“David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and said to him, ‘Why are you alone...?’ ... So the priest gave him the holy bread.”

<!--
* Jesus doesn't try to refute the fact that his disciples are violating the Sabbath.
    * This point seems to be conceded.
* Jesus's response begins with the analogy of David.
    * David is not condemned for entering sacred space and using the holy bread to provide for his companions.
    * In the same way, Jesus is able to utilize the sacred space of the Sabbath to provide for his disciples.
    * Notably, Jesus's retelling includes both the explicit mention of sacred space and the repated mention of the disciples.
        * This increases the story's relevance to the current situation.
* Jesus then proceeds to a second analogy from the Torah itself.
    * This features priests violating the law in permissible ways.
    * Just as David's purposes override the sacred space of the temple, the priests' duties override Sabbath.
        * In the same way, Jesus's presence and mission override the Sabbath.
        * Because the disciples are Jesus's agents and participate in his mission of restoration, they, like the priests, profane the Sabbath in a guitless way.
        * This is made somewhat more clear in Mark, which features the "feasting bridegroom" saying immediately prior to the grainpicking pericope.

# *m. Rosh Hashanah* 2:4--9
“With respect to two New Moons one may profane the Sabbath\.\.\.\. Because on them messengers go forth to Syria and on them the festivals were regulated\.\.\.\. For with respect to a journey of a night and a day one \[may\] profane the Sabbath and go forth to bring evidence of the New Moon, as it is said: ‘These are the set times of the Lord.\.\.\.’”

# *b. Shabbat* 132a
“Rather, this is the reason for the opinion of R. Eliezer, as the verse says: ‘And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised,’ indicating that he is circumcised on the eighth day even if it falls on Shabbat\.\.\.\. With regard to circumcision itself, everyone agrees that it overrides Shabbat.”

# Jesus's perspective on Torah takes into account the eschatological moment.

## Matt 12:18: “‘Here is my servant, whom I have chosen...’”
## Mk 2:19: “‘The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they?’”

# Jesus does not “abrograte” the Sabbath.

<!--
* Jesus's analogy does not provide a basis for ongoing Sabbath violation.
* He is explaining how his presence as the feasting bridegroom overrides the Sabbath in this particular instance.
    * We see this in the next pericope, where Jesus heals on the Sabbath.
    * Does the fact that Jesus permitted grainpicking and healed one person on the Sabbath justify ongoing Sabbath violation or a wholesale alteration of biblical law?
        * I don't think so.
* We also don't have a "lax" Jesus set against the "strict" Pharisees.
    * Jesus is not advocating for a more lenient interpretation of the Sabbath.
    * Rather, Jesus is handling the Sabbath in light of other, eschatological concerns.
        * "Mercy not sacrifice" is commonly use to set observance of biblical law against the love command or some other conception of ethical/non-ritual behavior.
        * "Mercy" hardly seems an appropriate description of the disciples' grainpicking.
        * However, (as Paul Sloan points out) "mercy" in Hosea indicates *restoration*; Hosea's answer to the question "how shall we return?" is "with mercy," i.e., with God's restoration.
* Jesus himself does not provide a clear basis for Christian modification of the Sabbath.
    * It's also not clear that Christians are to observe the Sabbath to begin with; Sabbath is not a part of the Noahide covenant and isn't referenced in Acts 15.
        * Given that the Sabbath is frequently discussed in terms of a covenantal sign between God and the nation of Israel, this might make sense.
    * Christian Sabbath observance is a theological/doctrinal development rather than a direct 1:1 following of biblical law.
    * The Christian Sabbath follows the creational pattern of work/rest but also follows the trajectory of Hebrews by pointing to the resurrection as the source of eschatological rest.
